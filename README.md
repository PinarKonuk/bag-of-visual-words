# Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) Image Classification

## üìã Project Description

This project implements the Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) approach for image classification. Using keypoint detection, feature extraction, clustering, and classification techniques, the project demonstrates how images can be represented and classified using visual vocabularies.

The key steps include:

* Keypoint Detection: Identify keypoints in images using algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, or ORB.

* Feature Extraction: Extract descriptors from keypoints to represent the image's features.

* Feature Clustering: Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to create a visual vocabulary.

* Image Representation: Represent images as histograms based on the frequency of visual words.

* Classification: Use classifiers like k-NN to predict the category of each image.

## üöÄ Features

* Resize and preprocess input images.

* Extract keypoints and descriptors using SIFT, SURF, or ORB.

* Build a Bag of Visual Words dictionary using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means).

* Classify images using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) with different distance metrics.

* Evaluate performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
  
## üîß Technologies Used

* Python: Programming language

* OpenCV: For image processing and keypoint detection

* NumPy: Numerical computations

* Matplotlib: Visualization of results

## üîç Technical Details

1. Keypoint Detection

Keypoints are detected using SIFT, SURF, or ORB algorithms, which identify distinctive points in the image.

2. Feature Extraction

Feature descriptors are extracted from the detected keypoints to represent image characteristics numerically.

3. Clustering and BOVW

Features are clustered into groups using K-Means to form the visual dictionary. Images are then represented as histograms based on the frequency of these clusters.

4. Classification

Images are classified using k-NN with different distance metrics, such as:

* Euclidean Distance

* Cosine Similarity

* Chi-Square Distance

5. Evaluation

Classification results are evaluated using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices, comparing different algorithms and parameter settings.
